The Directory contains the files for Reproducible Research [Week 2 Project] (https://github.com/rdpeng/RepData_PeerAssessment1) of Data Science in Coursera. 

Steps-Activity-Analysis.Rmd is the literate programming document for the project.
Steps-Activity-Analysis.html is the generated file when processing .Rmd with knitr. It's the file should be looked at when you score my project.
Other files are the side products when processing .Rmd with knitr and shouldn't be worried about.
