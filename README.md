The objective of the courses is that mastered the procedure and related techneques for data analysis with R. Each directory represents the contents for each course.

Directory|Description
---------|-----------
Data Cleaning| In this directory, I mainly did data ETL process.
Exploratory Data Analysis| I tried commonly used plot systems in R(*base*, *lattice*, *ggplot2*) to do explortatory analysis.
Reproducible Research| This directory involves the practise of techniques used to make the project reproducible. Including *knitr*, *Rpub*.
Machine Learning| The eventual result is the project that applied proper algorithms on the given data. Meanwhile, it also contains the learning materials.
